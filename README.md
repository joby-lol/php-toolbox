# Joby's PHP Toolbox

[![CI](https://github.com/joby-lol/php-toolbox/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/joby-lol/php-toolbox/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A lightweight collection of useful general purpose PHP tools with no dependencies. Committed to always at least having minimal dependencies.

## Development status

Anything that's in the `main` branch should have tests and be a stable API. I haven't set a version number yet because I don't want to call it 1.0 until I actually have a more significant number of features in here.
